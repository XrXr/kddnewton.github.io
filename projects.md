## Projects

I like to program - these days mostly in Ruby, TypeScript, and C. Most everything I do is open-sourced on GitHub. Below are the projects that I'm currently working on/thinking about the most these days.

* [kddnewton/mathlang](https://github.com/kddnewton/mathlang) - A small language for doing math.
* [prettier/plugin-ruby](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby) - A prettier plugin for the Ruby language
* [prettier/plugin-xml](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-xml) - A prettier plugin for the XML specification
* [vue-a11y/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility](https://github.com/vue-a11y/eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility) - An eslint plugin for checking Vue.js files are accessibility

I also actively maintain a lot of projects I've written in the past that I'm still happy with/are still serving their purpose. Below are a couple that I still look in on regularly.
